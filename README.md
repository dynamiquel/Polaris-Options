# Polaris Options
Polaris is a Game SDK for Unity that provides almost essential features. These features make sure your development time stays in what makes your game special.

Polaris Options is a subset of Polaris that allows developers to easily create, set and manage user options within their game.

It is designed to be a complete replacement for Unity PlayerPrefs that offers more features whiles being almost as easy to use.

If you are coming from Unity PlayerPrefs, the syntax is very similar and you should feel at home. However, if you want to come out of your box, you can use Options to do much more (it just requires a bit of learning).
