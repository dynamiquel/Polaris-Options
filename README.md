# Polaris Options
Polaris is a Game SDK for Unity that provides almost essential features. These features make sure your development time stays in what makes your game special.

## Introduction
Options is a subset of Polaris that allows developers to easily **create**, **set** and **manage** user options within their game.

It is designed to be a complete replacement for **[Unity PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html)** that offers more features whiles being almost as easy to use.

If you are coming from **[Unity PlayerPrefs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PlayerPrefs.html)**, the syntax is very similar and you should feel at home. However, if you want to come out of your box, you can use Options to do **much more** (it just requires a bit of learning).
